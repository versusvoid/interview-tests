Minimal tower defence game on naked C#/WPF. 

* 3 gun types
* 3 monster types
* 5 monster waves
* See how long can you survive!

According to task conditions, graphical part was insignificant, 
so guns and monsters are simply circles and squares.
Due (possibly) large number of game objects on field, game is rendered on bitmap in separate thread and 
displayed in UI.
