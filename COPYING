Notes:
Many ideas were taken from all over Internet, I do not own them, neither
can unlicense them. So do not blame me if one morning some google lawer
will knock at your door.
One HUGE source of inspirations was http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/,
thank you Evan Wallace, I did spend hours simply playing with your water.

OpenGL 2 sucks, I strongly advice you not to copy, use, compile, sell it.
PyQt is also somewhat proprietary, bear it in mind.


And if you find some bullshit 'bout MIT License in C# code - do not listen, VS 
makes this headers all by herself.
